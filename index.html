                <h2>Your smile brings me energy!</h2>
                <p>I am Stephanie or more often Steph or Stephou (pronounced like in Steph + fool without the final l). My friends called me Stephanie when they got frustrated with me! I should say that I will turn 29 soon but this number is definitely too close to 30 so let’s say I am only 28. </p>
                <p>I was born in the country where you can find as much bakeries as starbucks here. You guessed it: France. So please pardon my English, I am still working on it! </p>
            
                <h4>I will go straight to the point: I am crazy about food and especially pastries! </h4>

                <p>This passion did not started with the foodporn trend on Instagram. Much much earlier. When I was a child, I used to spend hours assisting my mum cooking and watching the only cuisine TV show. There was no “food network” channel, “The great British baking show” or “Tastemade” at this time; just one very boring, slow and classy chef cooking very traditional starred  recipes. I went to baking classes as a hobby during high school while all my “cool” friends were exercising at a gym or a ping-pong class. Following what I liked and my excellent grades, I picked the “food and nutrition” major at college while food was not a high-end topic. I am now a food scientist, meaning that I use my scientific knowledge to develop safe foods that you can find in supermarkets. During the last 5 years, my job have been to make chocolate tablets more affordable and to extract the most colorful part of nature (think of carrot or beet juices) to make fancy yogurts or beverages. When I am travelling abroad (for tourism or work), visiting supermarkets in one of the first things I love to do! The second thing is discovering the local desserts. I love baking (and eating). Nevertheless, what I enjoyed most is seeing stars shining in the eyes of people when they see and eat my pastries. It gives me even more energy to bake until the end of the night! As I was living on my own during the beginning of my career in Europe, I did not cook or bake a lot. I find it sad when you cannot share your meal with people. Hopefully, I am now living with my hubby in New York. It took us some time to find an apartment with a decent kitchen. But since then, a whole new cooking adventure has started….</p>

                <h2>How did the adventure start? </h2>
                <p>One day in October 2016, I saw an ad from the cookies company based in Brooklyn “Michel and Augustin” for a contest to win baking classes to prep the French pastry exam called “CAP”. The deadline to bring an original cake was in 24h…I tried to bake an horrible 1 thousand crepes cakes, flavored with maple. Well, the results was super gross as it was the very first attempt, without decent recipe or tool. I did not even dare bringing the cake to them. Today, I think I should have made something easier, traditional with a touch of originality; repeating the recipes 5 times and I could have been selected. I was so frustrated. There was something in my belly saying that I really wanted to be better at baking and take the challenge of having a diploma in it. Then, 1 year later, for visa reason, I had to stop my career for at least 6 months. At the beginning it was destabilizing and I did not know how to exploit this time. The minute from which I thought about taking the CAP exam, it became clear again in my head. The choice was obvious: let’s do it!So yes I’ve started to prepare the exam at home, thanks to books and social media.</p>

                    <p>For the exam, I have to bake for instance 1 layered cake, 16 croissants, 1 tart and 16 eclairs in 6 hours…</p>
                
                    <p>Obviously I need to train a lot!! It means finding volunteers to eat my cakes as I am against food waste! And yes, it is sometimes hard to find people willing to hate my cakes!  </p>

            <p>Amazing!! Just wow! After 6 months in it, I recommend to everyone to really pursue your passion, even if you think it is a “ridiculous” one. Go crazy about it and you will meet incredible people. You will learn a lot about yourself , your capacities and your values. I am not saying it will be easy but it is a valuable learning experience.</p>
            <p>I am now more more considering to run the <strong>NYC marathon</strong>! Something that I have had on my bucket list for a while!</p>
            <p>Also, stay open! I had never thought I could create a website and more importantly I enjoyed it! I hated my programming classes in C so much during college! This was possible thanks to the free HTML classes organized by the city of New York at my local library!</p>
            <p><strong>Two game changers here:</strong></p>
            <ul>     
                <li>The proximity (and thus you do not need to commute hours for something you’re not an absolute fan at the beginning)</li>
                <li>The teacher: a smart and sweet lady, talking like you and me. She explains things well, without using a vocabulary for nerds, and anticipates where everyone will bugs!</li>
            </ul>
